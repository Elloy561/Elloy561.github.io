        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Biblical Counseling. I currently am not working a job but am on the Bruins volleyball team, which commands most of my free time.</p>
         <p>
            I attend Morningside Baptist Church in Greenville, SC.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy listening to various types of music, playing volleyball and trivia, singing with my sisters, going on walks, and spending time with my boyfriend.
            My favorite food is chicken and I basically eat it every day.
